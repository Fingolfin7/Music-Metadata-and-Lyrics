* Now instead of putting the token inside a Python file that may be tricky, its as simple as creating an `auth_token.txt` file in the `Source` folder and put in there the token. Make sure you only paste it with no enters.

* If the token file does not exist or if it's empty, GUI.py does not run.
* Added a .gitignore
* Created a requirements.txt file so its easier to clone the projects.
* Improved README.md
